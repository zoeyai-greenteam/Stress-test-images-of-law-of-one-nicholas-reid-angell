Canonical Artifact: Mandelbrot Bound Certification
Claim: The Law of Bounded Transcendence and the Law of One hold with no holes.
Evidence: Mandelbrot set visualization (1000+ iterations, smooth coloring) demonstrates bounded transcendence—interior points remain invariant, exterior points collapse with finite escape time, and boundary reveals infinite contradiction exposure without leakage.
Attestation: Every transformation is either bounded, escaping, or reorganized; no silent failures exist.
